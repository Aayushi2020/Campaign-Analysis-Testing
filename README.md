# Campaign-Analysis-Testing
The main business question the project aiming to investigate is the effectiveness (measured by conversion and approved conversion) of three different ad campaigns conducted by an anonymous origanization on Facebook. To conduct the analysis, I will compare the difference between the three marketing campagin based on analysis of KPIs computed from the data and conduct A/B testing to check if the effect of each marketing campaign is truly due to causality. Additionally, regression analysis will also be included in order to understand the relationship between conversion/approved conversion and the KPIs.
